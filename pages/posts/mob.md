# Mob Programming

Mob programming and the power of Flow (Woody Zuill):

All the team working on the same thing.

- Knowledge sharing
- Continuous peer review
- Faster feedback
- Focus on the right thing
- Higher quality
- Eliminates queues & inventory
- Lower mental stack
- More engaging, fun, less stressful...

## "How can you be productive with 5 people at one computer?"

Productivity = Getting things done  
Effectiveness = Getting the right things done

Reduce "Question Queue Time", the amount of time one must wait to get an answer to a blocking question.

A blocked single individual working on something else generates more stock.

Longer cycle time, inventory, lower quality.

Context switching is mitigated.

As a group, the right things get done faster, the wrong things fade away.

## Psychological safety

**Project Aristle** is a research from Google (over 180+ teams) that points **psychological safety** as the most notable factor to their team's success, and confirms what's in the Drive book (autonomy, meaning, impact...).

In a **Mob Programming** group, people need to feel safe leaving/joining whenever they feel like they need time to think or work alone for a bit.  
This includes feeling safe experimenting, exploring, discovery, asking...
NASA devs create an environement where it is ok to not know something and ask, to minimise errors.
