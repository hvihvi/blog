# Kaizen

## 6 steps (loop)

1)Discover Improvement Potential
2)Analyze Current Methods
3)Generate Original Ideas
4)Develop implementation plan
5)implement
6)Evaluation new Methods

Note : (4) should be left out and become "just do it" most of the time.

### Discover Improvement Potential

7 types of waste :

- Overproduction (too much or too soon)
- Excess Motion (any motion that doesnt add value)
- Scrap & Rework (any repair, scrap, or rework)
- Overprocessing (overprocessing beyond requirement)
- Conveyance (Any nonessential transport beyond minimum required)
- Excess Inventory (Any more than the minimum required)
- Excess Wait Time (Waiting on parts or waiting for a machine to finish etc)

### Analyze

Ex: breakdown sheets, note time, action, comment and ideas while performing a task or watching someone.

### Idea generation

Creativity killers:

- Force of habit : resistance & fear of change
- Preconceptions : predict the outcome, often based on outdated data
- Common Sense : for example with kanban we can achieve more tasks with less effort, which is counter intuitive
- Not Invented Here Syndrome : the need to find a homemade solution
- Emotion : negative thinking, fear of change...

Creativity Advices:

- Separate Idea Generation and Judgment : to prevent killing an idea early
- Quantity over quality
- Think outside the box, from different perspective
- Combine ideas with others
- Review previous Analysis
- Synthesis Ideas

Brainstorming Rules :

- No criticizing or judgment during idea generation
- Speak freely
- Seek quantity
- Think together

### Planification and implementation

In most case, just do it.

### Evaluate the new method

Ensure an actual improvement happened, compare before/after, preferably with data.
Do a presentation/showcase to co-workers with Q&A session.
