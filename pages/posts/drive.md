# Drive - The surprising truth about what motivates us

This book uses social experiments to understand how motivation works.

## Mastery - Autonomy - Purpose

3 keys to motivation:

- Mastery
- Autonomy
- Purpose

## Flaws of carrot and stick

Most preconceived motivation factors such as "Carrot & stick" no longer work when we are past the survival threshold.

If-then rewards have a negative effect. They narrow our focus (ex: candle problem).
Ex: Paying blood donors decreased their numbers in half.

They encourage cheating, shortcuts and unethical behaviour and short-term thinking.

Instead, give rewards or praises / positive feedbacks after the task is complete.

## Experiments & Examples

## Candle experiment

The experiment gives participants a candle, a box of thumbtacks, and a book of matches, and asks them to attach the candle to the wall so that it doesn't drip onto the table below.
Participants that were **"incentivised"** by money rewards were **3min30 slower**.

Creativity is killed by Carrot & stick (extrinsic motivators). It does work for more simple & mechanical tasks.

### Microsoft Encarta vs Wikipedia

Encarta was build by well paid contributers and managers, but was overtaken by Wikipedia.

### Blood donor experiment

When paid to give blood, donations drop from 53% to 30% of tested subjects.
