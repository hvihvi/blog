# CSS Transitions

## transform

With transform, `%` are based on the element's size, `transform: translateX(calc(100% + 1px))` translates right by exactly its size + 1px.

### Trick to place Ã  close button above a card:

```css
.close-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}
```

It avoid messing with the card placement, place the button inside the card, place it `absolute` on the top right, and translate to place it above the card.

### js free hover navigation menus

A common issue is to hover a menu item, a list appears, and the mouse loses hover when trying to reach the list, making the menu hard to navigate.

With `transition-delay`, it is possible to make the dropdown last a bit longer.

```css
.menu-list {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 400ms;
  transition-delay: 300ms;
}
.menu-item:hover .menu-list {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 100ms;
  transition-delay: 0ms;
}
```

### flicker hover glitch

If a button moves up on hover, it is no longer hovered, then it comes back down, gets hovered, goes up... It flickers.

To solve this issue, we can use an inner element inside our button, that way the button's size increases when the inner element moves up and the glitch doesn't happen.
