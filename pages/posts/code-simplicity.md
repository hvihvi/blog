Desirability formula:

Desirability = (Value now + Value future) / (Effort implem + Effort maintenance)

Importance of maintenance and future value in the long run, compared to the simplified Value/Effort. Value "now" and Effort "implem" fade in the long run.

TL;DR:

> It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation
