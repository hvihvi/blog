# ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

A document (ex: markdown + git) that tracks decisions. Lives with the code.
A "decision" folder makes more sense than "ADR".

For visibility, reference in commit messages, README.md, comments...

Things worth mentioning:

- Issue
- Descision
- Status: WIP, proposal...
- Context
- Pros & Cons
- Expected outcome
- Constraints
- Consequences
