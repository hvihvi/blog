# CSS Carousel

Our pages' performances were affected by a jQuery Carousel (slow render, sluggish, layout shifts...).

It is possible to reproduce a "JS free" carousel effect via:

- `overflow: scroll`
- hide the scroll bar
- `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` (spring snap effect: https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type)

Gained ~20 lighthouse performance points. :stronks:
