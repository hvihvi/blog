# CSS Carousel

Our landing page's performance was highly affected by a Javascript carousel library (that used jQuery).  
Its cost measured by lighthouse was about 20 performance points.

It is possible to reproduce a "JS free" carousel effect via `overflow: scroll` and hide the scroll bar.  
Then use `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` to get the spring snap effect: https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type.
