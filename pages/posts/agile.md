# Absence of scrum @ big tech

deep dive article on the topic:
(How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum)[https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/]

Example: Skype (all in on scrum) vs Whatsapp (purposely ignore all heavy process) -> Whatsapp out-executed Skype and won the market.

- In the survey, 83% of engineers would advise against JIRA
- None of the big tech companies listed enforce a methodology like scrum or kanban

## Plan -> Build (Iterate) -> Ship

@ Amazon, Apple, Datadog, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Shopify, Uber...

Amazon has **6-pagers** for the "plan" phase.

Most go through an RFC-like phase before iterating.

Some use a Kanban-like process to work on the top priority.

Shopify calls it "GSD" (Get Sh\*t Done) in 6 week cycles.

The cycle is often around **6-8 weeks**, enough to ship something meaningful, but not too long to be able to see the end. Sometimes with a **2 week "cool down" period** to work on other things.

They all focus on:

- Product focused environments
- Empowered and autonomous teams
- A motivated engineer easily makes multiple times the impact of a "factory worker"
- Exposure to business & metrics

The product manager is not in charge of project management. They don't write tickets/tasks. They focus on vision, strategy & partnership.
Engineers carry most of the project management responsibility & create their own tasks.

Competent, autonomous people need less structure to produce reliable, high-quality output. Big Tech is able to attract, afford and hire these people.

Scrum/Jira is optimized for reporting => low trust environment

## 6-pager

- Structured as a narrative essay (no slides or bullet points)
- Clear purpose, background, problem/opportunity, solution, alternatives, risks, FAQs
- Meeting format: 20-30min of silent reading, then starts the discussion
