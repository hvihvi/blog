1. Epic meaning & calling => Purpose bigger than yourself
2. Development & accomplishment => Mastery
3. Empowerment of creativity & feedback => Autonomy
4. Ownership & possession
5. Social belonging & influence
6. Scarcity & Impatience => if you can't get something you'll keep thinking about it (ex: bait)
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity => more likely to play if there is gambling
8. Loss & Avoidance of pain => attachment to things acquired
