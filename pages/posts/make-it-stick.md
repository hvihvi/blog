# Make it stick - The Science of Successful Learning

Written by researchers, goes over what helps learn and what doesn't, backed by social experiments.

Most chapter titles are self explanatory:

- Learning is misunderstood
- To learn, retrieve
- Mix Up your practice
- Embrace difficulties
- Avoid illusion of knowing
- Get beyond learning styles
- Increase your abilities
- Make it stick

## Misconceptions

Repetition doesn't help.  
Low effort shortcuts overall don't help.
Focused effort doesn't help (single topic, long periods).
Learning styles/preferences (ex: hearing vs seeing) is a myth.

## Factual

Retireval practice improves knowledge and retention.
Spaced and varied practice helps (forces retrieval).
Struggling with a problem helps.
Effort helps overall. Generating examples, answers, methaphors help compared to checking an answer.
**Dunning-Krugger Effect:** The least competent overestimate their competence the most (Illusion of knowing)
Teaching how learning works first has positive impact.
Learning takes effort and effort changes the brain.
Metaphores, mental models help build a connexion to a pre-existing knowledge.

### Learning key steps

- Information is received in short-term memory, easily forgotten
- Consolidation: Memory traces are reorganised, linked to past knowledge, stabilised and stored in long-term memory
- Retrieval: Material fetched from long-term memory. This reinforces memory traces and reconsolidates them with new learnings
