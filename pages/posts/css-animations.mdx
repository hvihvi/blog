# CSS Animations

## Accessibility

Use media queries to remove animations for people who suffer from motion sickness and wish to disable animations.

Apply only when no preferences set (default):

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .animated {
    transition: transform 300ms;
  }
}
```

Or override to disable it:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animated {
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

It can be checked with JS as well:

```js
const prefersReducedMotion = !window.matchMedia(
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)'
).matches
```

## transform

With transform, `%` are based on the element's size, `transform: translateX(calc(100% + 1px))` translates right by exactly its size + 1px.

### Trick to place Ã  close button above a card:

```css
.close-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}
```

It avoid messing with the card placement, place the button inside the card, place it `absolute` on the top right, and translate to place it above the card.

## transitions

Website with various transition animations https://easings.net/

### js free hover navigation menus

A common issue is to hover a menu item, a list appears, and the mouse loses hover when trying to reach the list, making the menu hard to navigate.

With `transition-delay`, it is possible to make the dropdown last a bit longer.

```css
.menu-list {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 400ms;
  transition-delay: 300ms;
}
.menu-item:hover .menu-list {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 100ms;
  transition-delay: 0ms;
}
```

### flicker hover glitch

If a button moves up on hover, it is no longer hovered, then it comes back down, gets hovered, goes up... It flickers.

To solve this issue, we can use an inner element inside our button, that way the button's size increases when the inner element moves up and the glitch doesn't happen.

## Animations

### pure CSS spinner (infinite rotation)

```css
<style>
  @keyframes spin {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0turn);
    }
    to {
      transform: rotate(1turn);
    }
  }

  .svg-spinner {
    animation: spin 1000ms linear infinite;
  }
</style>

```

### grow and shrink

Use `%` instead of `from` and `to` and go back to initial state.

```css
<style>
  @keyframes grow-and-shrink {
    0% {
      transform: scale(1);
    }
    50% {
      transform: scale(1.5);
    }
    100% {
      transform: scale(1);
    }
  }

  .item {
    animation: grow-and-shrink 300ms;
  }
</style>
```

This can also be performed via `animation-direction: alternate` (or add `alternate` to the animation shorthand), which goes over the animation 0% to 100% and then backward from 100% to 0%.

### keep start and end styles with `both`

When entering or exiting an animation it goes back to the element's unanimated styles. Use `animation: ... both` to keep initial and final styles from the animation.

### CPU to GPU glitch

Sometimes start and end of the animation have minor glitches because CPU hands over to the GPU to do the work and they render a bit differently.
You can hint the browser to avoid this.

```css
.subject {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

### flipable card

Place 2 identical elements on top of each other and flip the back. Set the focus/hover trigger on the parent element to avoid glitches.
On hover/focus, rotate both (the back has an offset since it defaults to already flipped).

```html
<style>
  .card-wrapper {
    perspective: 500px;
  }
  .card {
    position: relative;
    display: block;
  }
  .front,
  .back {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 8px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    transition: transform 400ms;
    will-change: transform;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
  }
  .back {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    transform: rotateY(-180deg);
  }
  .card:hover .front,
  .card:focus .front {
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
  }
  .card:hover .back,
  .card:focus .back {
    transform: rotateY(0deg);
  }
</style>

<div class="card-wrapper">
  <a href="/" class="card">
    <div class="front">
      <p>This is the front</p>
    </div>
    <div class="back">
      <p>This is the back</p>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>
```
