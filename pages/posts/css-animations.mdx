# CSS Animations

## Accessibility

Remove animations for people who suffer from motion sickness.

Apply when no preferences set (default):

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .animated {
    transition: transform 300ms;
  }
}
```

Or override:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animated {
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

Or with JS:

```js
const prefersReducedMotion = !window.matchMedia(
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)'
).matches
```

## transform

With transform, `%` are based on the element's size, `transform: translateX(calc(100% + 1px))` translates right by exactly its size + 1px.

### Trick to place Ã  close button above a card:

```css
.close-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}
```

It avoids messing with the card placement.
Place it top right, and translate it above the card.

## transitions

Website with various transition animations https://easings.net/

### js free hover navigation menus

A common issue is to:

1. hover a menu item
2. a list appears
3. the mouse loses hover when trying to reach the list
4. the list disapears before we can reach the item ðŸ¥²

**Fix:** Use `transition-delay`, to make the dropdown last a bit longer.

```css
.menu-list {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 400ms;
  transition-delay: 300ms;
}
.menu-item:hover .menu-list {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 100ms;
  transition-delay: 0ms;
}
```

### flicker hover glitch

1. a button moves up on hover
2. it is no longer hovered
3. it comes back down
4. gets hovered
5. goes up
6. ... it flickers

**Fix:** Use an inner element inside our button -> the button's size increases when the inner element moves up and the glitch doesn't happen.

## Animations

### pure CSS spinner (infinite rotation)

```css
<style>
  @keyframes spin {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0turn);
    }
    to {
      transform: rotate(1turn);
    }
  }

  .svg-spinner {
    animation: spin 1000ms linear infinite;
  }
</style>

```

### grow and shrink

Use `%` instead of `from` and `to` and go back to initial state.

```css
<style>
  @keyframes grow-and-shrink {
    0% {
      transform: scale(1);
    }
    50% {
      transform: scale(1.5);
    }
    100% {
      transform: scale(1);
    }
  }

  .item {
    animation: grow-and-shrink 300ms;
  }
</style>
```

This can also be performed via `animation-direction: alternate` (or add `alternate` to the animation shorthand), which goes over the animation 0% to 100% and then backward from 100% to 0%.

### keep start and end styles with `both`

When entering or exiting an animation it goes back to the element's unanimated styles. Use `animation: ... both` to keep initial and final styles from the animation.

### CPU to GPU glitch

Sometimes start and end of the animation have minor glitches because CPU hands over to the GPU to do the work and they render a bit differently.
You can hint the browser to avoid this.

```css
.subject {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

### flipable card

Place 2 identical elements on top of each other and flip the back. Set the focus/hover trigger on the parent element to avoid glitches.
On hover/focus, rotate both (the back has an offset since it defaults to already flipped).

```html
<style>
  .card-wrapper {
    perspective: 500px;
  }
  .card {
    position: relative;
    display: block;
  }
  .front,
  .back {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 8px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    transition: transform 400ms;
    will-change: transform;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
  }
  .back {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    transform: rotateY(-180deg);
  }
  .card:hover .front,
  .card:focus .front {
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
  }
  .card:hover .back,
  .card:focus .back {
    transform: rotateY(0deg);
  }
</style>

<div class="card-wrapper">
  <a href="/" class="card">
    <div class="front">
      <p>This is the front</p>
    </div>
    <div class="back">
      <p>This is the back</p>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>
```
