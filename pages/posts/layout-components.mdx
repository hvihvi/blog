# Layout Components

Layout components are an abstraction on top of CSS.

Made popular by Mark Dalgleish's talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnV1u67_yVg on Braid's design-system https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Stack/.

Article on the subject by styled-component's creator https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin

At LesFurets, we were able to build a complete app without a single line of css.
CSS was only used in design-system components, which included a Box and a a Stack component for layout.

**Pros:**
- Share a common language with UX designers
- Ease of use (more so for devs uncomfortable with css)
- Use React composition
- Better encapsulation

**Cons:**
- Not as flexible as CSS to face high layout complexity
- hard to overcome unecessary divs in the DOM
- "responsive-in-JS" can be a bit verbose

## Box

An abstraction that represents space around a component. (Our UX designers use the word "spacing" so we went with it, but it's just padding)

```jsx
<Box horizontalSpacing="4px">
  <Child/>
</Box>

<Box spacingTop="2px" spacingLeft="10px">
  <Child/>
</Box>
```

Those `"2px"` declarations can be replaced with `const`s or a TS enum

## Stack

An abstraction that stacks components in a line or a pile.

Could use `/*prettier-ignore*/` for a visual code representation:

```jsx
<Stack column>
   <Child1/>
   <Child2/>
   <Child3/>
</Stack>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Stack line gap="2px"><Child1/><Child2/><Child3/></Stack>
```

Making the bundler translate indentation to line/column might be an idea to explore...

## Responsive in JS

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useMediaQuery(query) {
  const [matches, setMatches] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const media = window.matchMedia(query);
    if (media.matches !== matches) {
      setMatches(media.matches);
    }
    const listener = () => {
      setMatches(media.matches);
    };
    media.addListener(listener);
    return () => media.removeListener(listener);
  }, [matches, query]);

  return matches;
}

function Page() {
  let isPageWide = useMediaQuery('(min-width: 800px)')
	
	return <>
    {isPageWide && <UnnecessarySidebar />}
    <ImportantContent />
  </>
}
```

We abstract on top of this to match UX designer's language and their breakpoints:

```js
const {isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop} = useResponsive();
```
