# Responsive

## Media queries

Pixels are no longer exact values in modern devices, `@media (min-width: 551px)` coupled with `@media (max-width: 550px)` might create bugs at 550.5px resolutions.  
We can use `@media (min-width: 550.01px)` to work our way around this issue.

## Clamp values

Clamp values set min/ideal/max values, for example with width for a card:

```css
.card {
  width: clamp(500px, 65%, 800px);
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

<div
  style={{
    width: 'clamp(500px, 65%, 800px)',
    maxWidth: '100%',
    borderRadius: '4px',
    border: '1px solid #e2e8f0',
    padding: '24px',
    margin: '0 auto'
  }}
>
  This card takes at least 500px if the content is very short. It tries to have
  a width of 65%, but on very large screens stops at 800px. On very small
  screens it falls back to 100% width.
</div>

## Hide/Show

Use `display: none` with media queries to remove from the DOM.  
This is a better choice for React SSR (ex: Next.js), compared to JS alternatives, to get the right version on first render and not wait for hydration.

```css
.desktop-only {
  display: none;
}
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .desktop-only {
    display: block;
  }
  .desktop-only {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
