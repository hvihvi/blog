> State is the root of all evil. In particular functions with side effects should be avoided.

### Terminology

- **Pure functions**: No side effects, predictable, the same input always returns the same output
- **First-class functions**: when functions in a language are treated like any other variables
- **Mutations**: change the value assigned to a variable, setters, change an object/array...
- **Side-effects**: mutations, I/O...
- **Memo√Øsation**: if a function is predictable, the input-output map can be cached
- **Currying**: f(a, b) becomes f(a)(b), favors reuse of partial functions
